# Desktop-Music-Player

This desktop application has the hope of bringing all your music servies to one place. 

Current features
- Basic music functions functions (play, pause, skip, previous)
- Ability to search and download videos from youtube and save them to local hard drive through the application
- ability to create playlists out of saved videos

This application is still an active project with more planned features to be added. So far the youtube side works, what I will be adding 
soon is functionality to connect to your spotify, sound cloud and applue music accounts to create playlists with all your music in one 
place
